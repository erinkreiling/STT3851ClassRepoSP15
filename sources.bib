	abstract = {Background: Alcohol use disorders and social anxiety disorder are common and disabling conditions that frequently co-exist. Although there are efficacious treatments for each disorder, only two randomized controlled trials of interventions for these combined problems have been published. We developed a new integrated treatment for comorbid Social Anxiety Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder based on established Motivational Interviewing ({MI}) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ({CBT}) interventions for the separate disorders. Compared to established {MI}/{CBT} for alcohol use disorders this new intervention is hypothesised to lead to greater reductions in symptoms of social anxiety and alcohol use disorder and to produce greater improvements in quality of life. Higher levels of alcohol dependence will result in relatively poorer outcomes for the new integrated treatment. Methods/design: A randomised controlled trial comparing 9 sessions of individual integrated treatment for alcohol and social phobia with 9 sessions of treatment for alcohol use problems alone is proposed. Randomisation will be stratified for stable antidepressant use. Post treatment clinical assessments of alcohol consumption and diagnostic status at 3 and 6 month follow-up will be blind to allocation. Discussion: The proposed trial addresses a serious gap in treatment evidence and could potentially define the appropriate treatment for a large proportion of adults affected by these problems.},

	abstract = {Aims: This study explores whether associations between anxiety and alcohol and other substance use are already evident in middle adolescence, and whether general anxiety or symptoms of social phobia affect continuity of frequent alcohol use, frequent drunkenness and cannabis use. Methods: Data from the Adolescent Mental Health Cohort Study, a school-based Finnish survey among adolescents aged 15–16 years at baseline, was utilized to assess prevalence, incidence and continuity of symptoms of social phobia, general anxiety, frequent alcohol use, frequent drunkenness and cannabis use (which in this context was smoked ‘hashish’ of unknown constituency), and the associations between the substance use variables and the anxiety variables in 2-year follow-up. Results: Anxiety preceded substance use while no reciprocal associations were observed. Depression mediated the associations between anxiety and substance use. Symptoms of social phobia did not elevate the incidence of substance use, but general anxiety did. Frequent drunkenness was less significantly associated with anxiety than the other two substance use variables. Co-morbid general anxiety increased the persistence of frequent alcohol use while co-morbid social phobia decreased its persistence. Continuity of frequent drunkenness and cannabis use were unaffected by co-morbid anxiety. Conclusions: General anxiety in middle adolescence places adolescents at risk for concurrent and subsequent substance use. The risk may, however, be associated with co-morbid depression. Social phobia in middle adolescence may protect from substance use. Adolescents with internalizing symptoms may need guidance in coping with the symptoms even if the symptoms do not fulfil the criteria of mood or anxiety disorder.

	abstract = {Objective: Our study sought to identify sociodemographic, clinical, life perception, and service use characteristics that distinguish new cases of people dependent on substances from the general population; and to determine predictors of substance dependence over a 2-year period. Variables that differentiate people dependent on substances according to sex and age were also assessed. Methods: Among 2434 people who took part in an epidemiologic catchment area health survey at baseline, 2.2\% were identified with substance dependence at the second measurement time only. Using a comprehensive framework, various aspects were considered as predictors for multivariate statistics. Results: Participants with substance dependence at time 2 only showed worse clinical conditions, life events, life and health perception, and neighbourhood characteristics than other participants, but only 2.5\% used health care services. Male sex, younger age, stigmatization, and impulsiveness were predictors of substance dependence. Regarding sex, females with dependence were only more likely to suffer from social phobia than males. In terms of age categories, participants over 50 with substance dependence were more likely to have a lower household income and less social support than younger people. Conclusion: Stigmatization was the strongest predictor of substance dependence. Our study also confirmed that males and younger people were more likely to have substance dependence. Anti-stigmatization, prevention, and outreach programs are needed to overcome the reluctance of this clientele to use health care services. Health professionals should also pay more attention to life and health perception and neighbourhood characteristics of newly identified drug users. (English)},

This study investigated whether alcohol affected observer-rated 'safety behaviors' in a sample of socially anxious participants. It was hypothesized that alcohol would lead to increased eye contact and speaking time, and decreased nervous laughter and latency to respond to questions during a social interaction. Eighty-eight high social anxiety participants were randomly assigned to an alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverage condition and then took part in a videotaped social interaction with a trained confederate. Videos were coded for participant safety behaviors as well as confederate behavior. Alcohol had the hypothesized effect of increasing the length of time participants spent speaking during the interaction. Interestingly, confederates interacting with socially anxious participants in the alcohol condition behaved more positively toward them than confederates interacting with control beverage condition participants. Implications for understanding the high comorbidity of social phobia with alcohol use disorders are discussed.},

	abstract = {Although most conceptualizations of social anxiety emphasise that socially anxious individuals are overtly shy, and utilise avoidant behavioural strategies (e.g., risk-aversion, passivity, and submissiveness), there is tentative support for the existence of an approach-motivated subtype, characterised by risk taking and a greater propensity for substance misuse. It is likely that this subtype may help explain the reported co-occurrence of substance misuse and social anxiety. The current study sought to test via latent class analysis whether an approach-motivated social anxiety subtype could be identified within a community sample. A self-report questionnaire was completed by 351 participants (age: 18–74 years). Two distinct social anxiety subgroups were identified: one characterised by prototypical {SAD} symptomatology (i.e., behavioural inhibition and risk-avoidance), the second by elevated levels of rash impulsiveness, reward sensitivity, risk-taking and co-occurring substance use problems. The current findings provides support for the existence of a distinct approach-motivated social anxiety subtype and indicates that impulsivity may be critical to understanding the comorbid substance use symptomatology of these individuals.},
